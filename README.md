*A shutdown menu based of ReiNX Toolkit*


**Compiling:**

You'll need latest devkitpro and switch-sdl. You can install dependencies by running `pacman -S switch-sdl2 switch-sdl2_mixer switch-sdl2_gfx switch-sdl2_image switch-sdl2_ttf`.


**Features:**

 * It shuts down your Switch!

 * It reboots your Switch!

 * It reboots and loads payload from atmosphere/reboot_payload.bin (Atmosphere only, potentially dangerous for exFAT file systems)!

 * It can also reboot your Switch to RCM mode (Atmosphere only, potentially dangerous for exFAT file systems)!

 * It has light and dark mode!
